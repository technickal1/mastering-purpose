**A BRIEF BACKGROUND**

What is my direction? My determination? My motivation?

My life’s been rough, but, who’s hasn’t? Throughout my journey, I’ve been a part of some great teams of people. One thing always persisted — I didn’t feel a sense of purpose with each occupation I was in.

Tragedies in my life led me to a greater story –- defining my purpose. So I anchored myself down, found out what I was good at, and decided that my purpose in life was to share my skills to the world.

A guy named Steve Jobs said it best:

> Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.

**HOW MASTERING PURPOSE STARTED**

The Start Of An Entrepreneurial Journey

In 2011, I started attending college in order to pursue what I thought were my passions – information technology. I truly thought that working in the IT world was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life – things like programming, software, hardware, the works.

Throughout college, life happened. My wife and I had kids. College took longer than expected. What happened? My two-year college degree took almost 5. Cutting down on classes, working full-time, and trying to make it took a toll on the most precious resource I had — time.

After working at multiple places and struggling to find where I could maximize the use of knowledge in my head, I forced myself to drive toward life goals with purpose and all the while using what I’m good at.

**\-01 FIND YOUR SKILLS.**

What are the things that come naturally to you? Are you a photographer or great teacher? Do you have a serious writing strategy that helps you? Find what interests you and put time into it.

**\-02 MASTER THEM.**

Once you find out what you’re good at/love to do (there’s a difference!) then learn everything you can about it. Study it, read about it and practice. Don’t forget, mastering a skill takes time.

**\-03 DEFINE YOUR PURPOSE.**

We deeply desire to understand what our purpose is and our “calling” here on Earth. Living with purpose helps define who you are and will help you understand how to help others.
